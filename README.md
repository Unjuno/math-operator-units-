# Math Operator Units

This repository studies **logit-space semantics for model control** through operator-specific model units.

The goal is not primarily to build a neural calculator, a faster router, or a replacement for symbolic computation. The goal is to define human-interpretable bias operations in logit space, learn small modules for those operations, and test whether their softmax and verifier effects survive correction and composition.

Each operator unit has two components:

```text
U_k = (M_k, C_k)
```

- `M_k`: main operator model that produces an operator-specific bias, logit contribution, or proposal.
- `C_k`: corrector / gate that suppresses the unit when the operator is not applicable.

The runtime fusion rule is:

```text
z_final = z_0 + Σ_{k in S_runtime} g_k(x) b_k(x)
```

where `S_runtime` is the selected runtime fusion set for the current task or experiment. The full registry may contain many units, but only the selected runtime set is loaded for a run. Within that set, irrelevant units are suppressed by their own correctors.

## Project framing

A control direction is represented as a bias field over the vocabulary:

```text
B(v | x) ∈ R^{|V|}
```

Its meaning is defined by its induced distributional and verifier effects:

```text
Δp_B = softmax(z_0 + B) - softmax(z_0)
ΔV(B) = E_{y ~ p_B}[V(y)] - E_{y ~ p_0}[V(y)]
```

The mathematical operator experiments are controlled proxies for this goal. They test whether learned bias operators such as composition, difference, projection removal, agreement, completion, and residual decomposition can be learned, corrected, and composed before moving to less transparent LLM settings.

## Core design rules

1. The operator registry is the source of truth.
2. A unit checkpoint is an implementation of a registry entry.
3. Primitive operators may have learned units.
4. Derived operators should usually be represented as programs over primitives.
5. Distilled derived operators are allowed only when explicitly marked.
6. The tokenizer is part of the model ABI and must be fixed per tokenizer version.
7. Fusion is allowed only between checkpoints with the same tokenizer profile and vocabulary hash.
8. Mathematical and non-mathematical operators are separated by `kind`.
9. `dispatch` must remain false in runtime fusion manifests.
10. Numbers, equality, and structural expression tokens are shared ABI tokens across all units.
11. Operator units learn transformation distributions over the shared numeric/equality ABI; they must not redefine numbers or equality.
12. Raw fusion must not assume inactive units are neutral; corrected fusion must measure and suppress inactive bias leakage.
13. A learned bias module has semantic force only through its measured softmax/verifier effect and its applicability-corrected contribution.

## Initial operator focus

The first learned units should target:

```text
<OP_SCALAR_ZERO>
<OP_SCALAR_ID>
<OP_SCALAR_NEG>
<OP_SCALAR_ADD>
<OP_SCALAR_ABS>
<OP_SCALAR_POS>
<OP_SCALAR_MIN>
<OP_SCALAR_MAX>
<OP_BIAS_ADD>
<OP_BIAS_SUB>
<OP_BIAS_CENTER>
<OP_BIAS_POS>
<OP_CTRL_GATE>
<OP_CTRL_SUPPRESS>
<OP_CTRL_ABSTAIN>
```

The first evaluation target is not broad problem solving. It is reproducible verification that runtime-selected fusion suppresses inactive units and preserves active units.

## Preliminary raw fusion observation

Early 0.1K proxy experiments suggest that inactive operator models do not reliably produce neutral outputs on out-of-distribution inputs. For example, an ADD-only model exposed to subtraction-like inputs can assimilate the unknown operator into addition, producing peaked but wrong predictions rather than uncertainty.

This motivates treating a stable fusion unit as a pair:

```text
operator unit = main model + applicability corrector
```

The main model proposes an operator-specific contribution. The corrector suppresses that contribution when the operator is inactive, unknown, or out-of-domain.

## Shared numeric and equality ABI

Numbers and equality are common infrastructure, not operator-specific semantics.

```text
shared ABI:
  numeric tokens
  equality token
  structural expression tokens

operator-specific layer:
  ADD transformation distribution
  MUL transformation distribution
  NEG transformation distribution
  VERIFY / PROGRESS / STOP judgments
```

For example, `ADD` and `MUL` may propose different transformations, but they must use the same numeric token meanings and the same equality relation marker.

```text
<OP_ADD> <NEXT_EQ> 3 + 4 + 5 -> 7 + 5
<OP_MUL> <NEXT_EQ> 3 * 4 * 5 -> 12 * 5
<VERIFY_EQ> 6 = 6 -> VALID
<PROGRESS?> 6 = 6 -> NO_PROGRESS
```

Valid equivalence is not the same as useful progress. Equality traces must therefore separate next-step proposal, verification, progress scoring, and stop decisions.
