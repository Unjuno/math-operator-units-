# Preregistered Experiment Plan v2

This plan prospectively extends v1 before the target-GPU pilot and before any final IID/OOD result is inspected. The raw all-five sum remains the confirmatory test; fallback mixers are secondary rescue analyses and cannot convert a failed raw-sum result into a successful primary result.

## Unchanged primary experiment

For `B_k(x)=z_k(x)-z_base(x)`, the primary condition is:

```text
z_raw(x) = z_base(x) + sum_k B_k(x)
alpha = 1.0
```

The comparator is the Relevant Specialist and the endpoint is exact trace validity. Seeds 0, 1, and 2 are the replication units. The final splits remain `iid_test`, `operand_ood`, and `length_ood`, with evaluation seed `700000`, 64 examples per operator, and `subset_31`.

## Added stage: fusion calibration

After model construction and every production `selected.pt` are frozen, but before final splits are opened, evaluate the mixing ladder on production validation. Escalate beyond fixed `bias_mean` when any validation condition holds:

```text
mean raw-minus-relevant trace gap < -0.02
worst-operator trace gap < -0.05
mean raw-minus-relevant EOS gap < -0.02
```

A failure first observed on final data cannot trigger tuning.

## Mixing ladder

Use the first family that satisfies the rescue rule. Parameters must be shared across seeds and operators.

### F0 — fixed baselines

```text
raw_sum:   z = z_base + sum_k B_k
bias_mean: z = z_base + (1/K) sum_k B_k
```

### F1 — global shrinkage

```text
z = z_base + alpha * sum_k B_k
alpha in {0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00}
```

One alpha is used for every seed, operator, position, and final split. The same alpha grid is reused by F2–F4 after their family-specific field transformation so amplitude control is comparable across families.

### F2 — norm-controlled fields

First center each field over vocabulary:

```text
C_k = B_k - mean_vocab(B_k)
```

Evaluate:

- **RMS-equalized mean:** inverse-scale each field by its production-validation RMS, restore the median RMS, then average;
- **RMS-clipped sum:** cap response-position RMS at validation quantile `q in {0.90, 0.95, 0.99}` before summing.

Apply one alpha from the F1 grid after normalization or clipping. No operator-specific scale is permitted.

### F3 — static nonnegative weighted mean

```text
z = z_base + alpha * sum_k pi_k B_k
pi_k = softmax(a_k)
```

The five weights and alpha are constant across prompts, operators, seeds, and token positions. Alpha uses the F1 grid. Fit the weights with regularization toward uniform values. This tests systematic scale imbalance without introducing routing.

### F4 — deterministic consensus-tempered decoding

At each token position let `p_k=softmax(z_base+B_k)`, let `p_bar` be their uniform probability mean, and set:

```text
d_k = JSD(p_k, p_bar)
w_k proportional to exp(-beta*d_k)
beta in {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}
z = z_base + alpha * sum_k w_k B_k
```

Alpha uses the F1 grid. This method is input-dependent but has no trained router. It must be labeled consensus-tempered decoding, not raw composition. Because the relevant unit can legitimately disagree with inactive units, improvement is not assumed.

### F5 — learned router or corrector

Prompt-dependent gating, a learned router, or a residual logit corrector changes the scientific question and is excluded from the present confirmatory final evaluation. If F0–F4 fail, begin a new versioned study with a dedicated fusion-calibration partition, new output roots, a linear mixer before nonlinear correction, and the known operator-tag router only as an oracle upper bound.

## Validation protocol

Assess F1–F4 with three-fold leave-one-training-seed-out validation. Tune on two production seeds and score on the held-out seed. Never tune per seed or per operator.

A family is eligible only if held-out results satisfy:

```text
mean trace-gap improvement over raw_sum >= 0.02
mean EOS gap to Relevant Specialist >= -0.02
mean final-value gap to Relevant Specialist >= -0.02
worst-operator trace gap >= -0.05
improvement on at least 2 of 3 held-out seeds
```

Select the earliest eligible family in order F1, F2, F3, F4. Within a family, maximize held-out trace validity, then final-value accuracy, then EOS accuracy, then prefer the simpler or more strongly shrunk setting. Refit only the selected family's permitted statistics on all production validation data, write a machine-readable mixer contract, and freeze it before final evaluation.

If no family qualifies, stop searching. The conclusion is that the fields are not recoverably composable under the preregistered non-router families.

## Final reporting

The primary table always contains Relevant Specialist, raw sum, bias mean, and matched Joint. A prospectively frozen rescue mixer is reported as a labeled secondary condition on every final split.

Report every seed and operator, equal-weight seed mean and standard deviation, worst-operator gap, rescue improvement over raw sum, absolute gap to Relevant Specialist, EOS/final-value guardrails, validation folds, hyperparameters, and mixer-contract hash.

A rescue may be practically useful if it meets the preserved-composition thresholds on final data, but the raw-sum result remains the confirmatory answer. Any method chosen after final data are viewed is post hoc.
